## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some of the challenges that I encountered while building the app was that I was not able to create the feature such that when you select a default tip on the settings page, it would save and be reflected on the calculator screen. Another challenge I encountered was that the top navigation bar seemed to be in the right place on Main.storyboard but for some reason when I launch the app, it is not in the correct position and I was not able to fix this issue.
